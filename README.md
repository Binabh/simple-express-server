# Simple express server for logging

This is a simple express server that logs the data it receives at the endpoint. I use this to log the data sent to web during mobile app development.

This is more useful when you have a library directly communicating with endpoint and have no idea about what is the structure of data its transmitting.

# To start server

`node index.js`

then access your server from phone.
